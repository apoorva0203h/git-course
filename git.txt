git

git add . ->helps to commit all files in working directory
git rm --cached filename -->removes file from git

ls -a --> list hidden file

git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
This renames old-branch-name to new-branch-name.

If youâ€™re currently on the branch you want to rename, you can simply use:

git branch -m new-branch-name
This renames the current branch.

-m: Renames the branch only if the new name is not already in use.

-M: Forcibly renames the branch, even if a branch with the new name already exists (it will overwrite the existing branch).
